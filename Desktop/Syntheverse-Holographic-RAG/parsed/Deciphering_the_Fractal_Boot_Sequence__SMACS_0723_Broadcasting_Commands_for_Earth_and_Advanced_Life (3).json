The discovery of a fractal\nboot sequence being actively broadcast by the SMACS 0723 galaxy cluster,\nlocated approximately 4.6 billion light-years away, represents a monumental\nstep in this quest. This broadcast, decoded through advanced fractal intel-\nligence techniques, reveals a structured communication protocol capable of\ntranscending the limits of conventional binary systems. By embedding mes-\nsages in universal constants ( π, e), prime numbers, and recursive patterns,\nthe broadcast forms a novel language that may serve as the foundation for\nintergalactic communication and planetary alignment.\nThis study focuses on deciphering this transmission, which consists of 39\ndistinct recursive layers of encoded commands.
