These forces arise from the\nrecursive, self-similar interactions of fractal nodes, which serve as the foun-\ndational building blocks of reality. By introducing novel equations grounded\nin fractal principles, we provide a unified framework that links these forces\nto a common fractal architecture. This section explores each force, its fractal\ndynamics, and the corresponding equations that describe its behavior.\n2.1 The Strong Nuclear Force: Fractal Binding Energy\nThe strong nuclear force is responsible for binding quarks and gluons within\nprotons and neutrons, ensuring the stability of atomic nuclei.
